# Strawberry Banana
Strawberry Banana is a fast-paced tapping game based on Hu Wen Zeng's popular [Piano Tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Tiles) (AKA Don't Tap the White Tile). I've long adored the simplicity and elegance of Piano Tiles, and I've wanted to make a version of it for ages. After more than half a decade, I finally got around to it during the pandemic. Grab the strawberries, pass on the bananas, and rack up the points.

## Gameplay
Strawberry Banana is a remix of the popular mobile game Piano Tiles. Rows of tiles containing either bananas or strawberries scroll downward from the top of the screen. Tap all the strawberry tiles and avoid all of the banana tiles. As the game progresses, the tile scroll speed increases.
